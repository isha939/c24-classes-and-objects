In matter.js we have setAngle, which sets the angle of the body instantly. Angular velocity, position, force etc. are unchanged.

The angle here does not refer to the unit of “degrees”. It is specified as radian.

In the unit of radians:
PI = 180 degrees;
PI/2 = 90 degrees;
PI/4 = 45 degrees and so on

Note: PI stands for the mathematical pi symbol.
(PI in radians = 180 degrees).

Let us create a Log object just above these Boxes.
Remember, we need our Log at 90 degrees.
In radians, 90 degrees = PI/2.
The Logs in the object also have a fixed width.

Consider you are skating on an ice ring and your friend on the road.
Can you tell me which one is smoother?

The reason why skating on an ice ring is easier because the force of friction is lesser there.
Friction is a force exerted by the surface when an object moves on it.
In matter.js, the value of friction is always positive and is in the range (0,1).
A value of 0 means that the body may slide indefinitely. A value of 1 means the body may come to a stop almost instantly after a force is applied.

Finally, let's create a Bird Class. We do not have the catapult ready yet.
So, we will do this.
1. Our Bird Class will be similar to Pig class.
2. We will make the Bird Class move with the Mouse.
